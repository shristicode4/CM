Contact Management

Steps:

1. Clone the repository in your system
2. cd crudcm (go inside the folder)
3. npm i (install the node packages)
4. npm start
5. npm run json-server (this runs the json-server)

This is a contact management app.
Click on Add User button present in the home page -> This takes you to Add User section.
Add the details of the user and click on Add Use button.
Now on All Users section the table with the deatils of user mention.
On clicking on the delete button, one can delete the contact.
On clicking on edit button ,one can edit the ocntact details.

CHallenges: The process of crud operation and playing with MUI components was smooth. However , I faced a liltle challenge on linking the api on updating the edit section on the table.Which I soon conqured, the error was due to mismatch of IDs fetched.

"Hope you like it!"
